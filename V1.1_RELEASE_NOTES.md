### 3. Factor Attribution

**What It Does:**  
Breaks down your portfolio's performance by investment factor to show what's driving your returns.

**What You See:**

For each factor in your portfolio:
- Weight in portfolio
- Return contribution
- Volatility contribution
- Beta (vs S&P 500)
- Alpha (skill-based excess return)
- Holdings in that factor

**Example:**

```
Your Portfolio: 12.45% return, 1.85% alpha

FACTOR BREAKDOWN:

Market Factor (VOO: 40%)
- Return Contribution: 4.98%
- Volatility: 18.2%
- Beta: 1.00
- Alpha: 0.12%

Dividend Factor (SCHD: 30%)
- Return Contribution: 3.74%
- Volatility: 16.1%
- Beta: 0.95
- Alpha: 0.95%

International Factor (VEU: 20%)
- Return Contribution: 2.49%
- Volatility: 20.3%
- Beta: 0.85
- Alpha: 0.68%

Bonds Factor (BND: 10%)
- Return Contribution: 1.24%
- Volatility: 4.2%
- Beta: 0.10
- Alpha: 0.10%
```

**Key Insights:**

- **Which factors are generating alpha?**
  - Focus on factors with positive alpha
  - Consider reducing factors with negative alpha

- **Which factors contribute most to risk?**
  - High volatility factors drive portfolio volatility
  - May want to reduce allocation

- **Is your factor diversification working?**
  - Check if factors have different betas
  - Look for complementary alpha sources

**How to Use:**

1. Click **"📊 Factor Attribution"** in Analysis view
2. Review each factor's contribution
3. Identify alpha-generating factors
4. Spot factors adding risk without return
5. Rebalance accordingly
6. Export detailed breakdown

**Actionable Examples:**

**If growth factor has negative alpha:**
→ Reduce growth allocation, add value

**If dividend factor has high alpha:**
→ Increase dividend allocation

**If international has low correlation + positive alpha:**
→ Keep or increase for diversification

- ❌ Options strategies (V2.0)
- ❌ Tax optimization (V1.2)
- ❌ Real-time data (V1.2)
- ❌ Portfolio backtesting comparison (V1.2)

### Known Limitations

1. **Optimizer Accuracy:**
   - Grid search is not true mathematical optimization
   - Results may be local maxima, not global
   - Use as guidance, not absolute truth

2. **Regime Detection:**
   - Based on 1-year rolling window
   - Backward-looking, not predictive
   - Regime can change quickly

3. **Factor Attribution:**
   - Assumes factors are independent (they're not)
   - Simplified alpha decomposition
   - Actual interactions may be more complex

4. **Export Formats:**
   - CSV only (no native Excel format yet)
   - No PDF export (use print-to-PDF)
   - No automated emailing

### Best Practices with V1.1

**DO:**
- ✅ Use optimizer to explore alternatives
- ✅ Check regime monthly
- ✅ Review factor attribution quarterly
- ✅ Export and track results over time
- ✅ Combine all features for comprehensive analysis

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Blindly apply optimizer results
- ❌ Over-trade based on regime changes
- ❌ Ignore your investment thesis
- ❌ Chase short-term alpha
- ❌ Forget about taxes and fees
